I.   INTRODUCTION  
Plagiarism  is  a  very  serious  and  common  problem  in 
Research.  Stealing  of  someone  else  work  is  not  only  common 
among research  scholars but also very common among  faculty 
members.  There  have  been many  plagiarism  cases  detected  in 
India  and  abroad.  For  example,  The  first  case:  A  research 
scholars  awarded  Ph.D.  in  the  year  1976  for  his  thesis  in 
English  entitled,  “A  Critical  Study  of  the  Suta  Samhita”.  As 
per  his  allegation,  almost  80%  of  his  thesis  has  been 
plagiarized  by  “another  scholar”  [1]  in  Hindi  verbatim 
including  footnotes,  charts  and  tables.  This  scholar  submitted 
his  thesis  entitled,  “Suta  Samhita  ka  Alocanatmak  Adhyayan” 
to  another  University  and  got  Ph.D.  in  the  year  1981.  In  the 
second case: A  “vice-chancellor”  [2] resigned  in 2003 after he 

and  a  student  were  found  guilty  of  plagiarism  of  a  paper 
(which formed part of the student's thesis). In the third case: A 
“professor”  [3]  is  accused  of  plagiarizing  more  than  70 
research  papers  published  between  2004  and  2007. University 
Executive  Council  has  banned  him 
from  undertaking 
examination  work  and  research  guidance.  He  has  been 
debarred  from  securing  further  promotions  and  appointments 
to  administrative  positions.  In  the  fourth  case:  A  “Chancellor 
and  the  Education Minister”  [4]  for  the  country,  has  resigned 
after  her  Ph.D.  was  revoked  following  an  investigation  into 
her  doctoral  thesis  that  found  evidence  of  plagiarism.  Above 
motioned  cases  not  only  describe  the  seriousness  of  the 
problem  but  also  show  that  plagiarism  can  destroy  any  one’s 
career. 
In  the  age  of  advanced  Information  and  Communication 
Technologies  (ICT)  plagiarism  has  become  more  actual  and 
turned  into  a  serious  problem.  Many  tools  have  been 
developed  for  detecting  similarities  in  files  [5].  These  tools 
automate  the  detection  process  and  allow  the  academic  to 
carry out the investigation process manually [6]. 
Plagiarism  detection  software  benefits  academicians, 
research  scholars and anyone  else  interested  in  safeguard  their 
writing.  By  using  plagiarism  detection  software  one  can 
ensure  that  the  text  is  unique.  Through  plagiarism  detection 
tools  research community can benefit by  having  their  research 
paper/theses  and  dissertation  checked  for  any  plagiarism  done 
unintentionally.

is    no  software  that  can  100%  detect  or    prove  that  the 
document has been plagiarize, because each software and tools 
has  advantages  and  limitation. Arbib &  Eti Yaari  [8]  find  that 
students  perceive  plagiarism  offences  from  online  sources  as 
significantly  less dishonest  than  similar offences  using printed 
sources.  Smith,   Ghazali, & Minhad  [9]  suggested  that  factors 
contributing  to plagiarism include  lack  of  awareness,  lack  of 
understanding,  lack  of  competence,  and  personal attitudes. No 
evidence  was  found  to  support  the  suggestion  that  either 
pressure  or  the  availability  of  internet  facilities  had  increased 
the  incidence  of  plagiarism.  Kwong,  Ng, Mark  &  Wong  [10] 
find  that  faculty  members  and  students  do  not  share  a 
consensus

Zimerman  [11]  find  that  there  is  a  definite  problem  involved 
in  the  interaction  of  international  student  in  the  higher 
education  setting  and  plagiarism.  Kaner  &  Fiedler  [12]  say 
that an appearance of  successful plagiarism prevention may  in 
fact  reflect  better  training  of  students  to  avoid  plagiarism 
detection  .Gorman  [13]  says  “Plagiarism has  been  common 
plagiarism for  fear  of  litigation.  “Litigation(cid:486)creep”  has  spread, 
among  generations  of  students  in  secondary  and  tertiary 
education  and  the  situation  has  not  improved.  Many  tertiary

institutions  almost  never  make  a  forceful  response  to  cases  of 
with universities regularly adopting avoidance measures rather 
Salim  and  Abraham  [14]  “Among  the  ways  of  plagiarism 
prevention is the use of plagiarism detectors; Turnitin is a very 
popular one. Academic institutions, publishers, and conference 
management  systems  have  started  to  use  detectors.  Examples 
include,  but  not  limited  to,  WCopyFind  that  is  used  by  the 
University  of  Virginia,  CrossCheck  that  is  invested  by 
Elsevier,  Springer,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology 
press,  and  other  renowned  publishers,  Docoloc  that  is 
integrated  with  EDAS  conference  management  system. 
Nowadays, many anti plagiarism tools have been built and can 
be found on the Internet”. 
III.  OBJECTIVE 
The objectives of this paper are as follows: 
•  To  identify  the  plagiarism  detection  tools  which 
are freely available online; and 
•  To suggest how to avoid plagiarism in research.  

IV.  SCOPE & LIMITATION 
There  are  many  commercial  plagiarism  software  available 
viz.    Copy  Catch  Gold,  EVE2:Essay  Verification  Engine,  J 
Plag,  Moss,  Turnitin,  EduTie.com,  PlagiServe,  Wordcheck 
etc.  but  this  paper    covers  anti-  plagiarism  tools  which  are 
freely available  online . 

V.   PLAGIARISM  
The  word  ‘plagiarism’  comes  from  the  Latin  word 
‘plagiare’  which  means  “to  kidnap’.  Plagiarism  is  a  type  of 
cheating  where  students  present  the  work  of  others  as  their 
own  for  the  purpose  of  academic  credit.  [15].  Plagiarism  is 
defined in many different ways, 
“Unacknowledged copying of documents or programs’’ [16] 
“The presentation of another person’s ideas or materials as if it 
were ones own” [17] 
“ The submission of the part or all of another person’s work as 
if  it  were  ones  own, without  the  knowledge  of  the  author  ,and 
with intention to deceive”[18] 
As  a  general  working  definition,  Office  of  Research 
Integrity  (ORI)  [19]  considers  plagiarism  to  include  both  the 

VI.  CIRCUMSTANCES OF PLAGIARISM 
Plagiarism  occur  under 
is 
two  circumstances  one 
intentional  another  is  unintentional.  “plagiarism,  a  form  of 
intellectual  dishonesty, 
involves  unintentionally  using 
someone  else's  work  without  properly  acknowledging  where 
the  idea(s)  came  from  (the  most  common  form  of  plagiarism) 
or  intentionally  copying  someone  else's  work  and  passing  it 
off as your own (the most serious form of plagiarism)”[20]. 

A.  Intentional plagiarism   
Intentional  plagiarism  occur 
intentionally 
if  person 
copying  other  material  and  not  citing  the  source  deliberately. 
It  includes,  copying  other’s  work,  copy  and  pasting  form 
online source, purchasing papers from paper mills etc. 

B.  Unintentional plagiarism 
Unintentional  plagiarism  occurs  when  even  if  a  person 
does  not  have  any    intention  to  plagiarized   but  he/she  has  not 
given  the  references  in  proper  manner    then  they  indulged  in 
plagiarism.  “Unintentional  plagiarism 
includes  careless 
paraphrasing,  paraphrasing  a  source  without  citing,  forget 
footnote etc.” [21]. 

VII. PLAGIARISM DETECTION TOOLS/SOFTWARE 
“Plagiarism  detection  is  the  process  of  featuring  the 
document,  analyzing  its  content,  unveiling  portions  that might 
be  plagiarized,  and  bringing  similar  source  documents,  if  they 
are  available.”  [22]  “Using  plagiarism  detection  tools  would 
benefit  the  scholarly  publication  process  by  helping  authors 
examine  their  own  work  and  by  allowing  reviewers  and 
editors to detect and deter plagiarism prior to publication.”[23] 
Plagiarism tools, while invaluable for discovering potential 
problems,  can  also  expose  cases  where  judgments  depend  on 
complex circumstances.[24].  
Plagiarism  detection  tools/Anti  –plagiarism  software  can 
be divided into two groups. 
A.  Proprietary/Commercial  anti-plagiarism 
software 
B.  Free online plagiarism tools/software 

A.  Proprietary or Commercial anti-plagiarism software/tools 
the  Latin 
“The 
from 
term proprietary is  derived 
word proprietas meaning property.  Proprietary 
software is 
software that is owned by an individual or a company (usually 
the  one 
that  developed 
it)”[25].  There 
is  a 
lot  of 
proprietary/commercial  anti-plagiarism  software  viz.  Turnitin, 
CopyCatch  Gold,  EVE2:Essay  Verification  Engine,  J  Plag, 
Moss  ,EduTie.com,  PlagiServe, Wordcheck  etc.  For  using  the 
commercial software user has to purchase the software. 

B.  Free online software/tools 
“Free software, which is generally the same as open source 
software,  is  available  at  no  cost  to  everyone,  and  it  can  be
