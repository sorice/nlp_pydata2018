Abstract—Plagiarism  is a serious problem  identified amongst 
research  community.  Plagiarism  has  been  around  for  centuries, 
but  with  the  use  of  Internet  and  easy  access  to  material  in 
electronic  format  has  made  it  easier  to  plagiarize  materials  of 
others. On  the  other  hand  plagiarism  detection  is  now  as  easy  as 
plagiarizing  a  document.  There  are  a  number  of  anti-plagiarism 
software  available  either  freely  or  commercially,  which  can  be 
used  for  plagiarism  detection.  But  the  commercial  softwares  are 
too  expensive.  So  it  is  not  affordable  for  an  individual  to 
purchase  those  softwares.  This  paper  highlights  the  plagiarism 
detection  softwares which  are  freely  available  online,  that  can  be 
downloaded free of cost. It is suggested that faculty members and 
research  scholars  can  use  these  anti  plagiarism  softwares  in 
checking  their  thesis  or  research  papers  before  submitting  to 
universities or conferences.  

Identifying  the  plagiarized  content  has  become  one  of  the 
major  concerns  of  journals  publishers,  research  center  and 
conferences  organisers.  The  software  that  are  mentioned  and 
referred  to  in  this  paper  are  all  valuable  resources  to  discover 
plagiarized  materials.  By  employing  these  softwares  one  can 
ascertain that none of the articles, documents or research work in 
any  form  and  capacity,  is  not  plagiarized  and  thereby  the 
copyright  of  the  publisher  and  the  authors  are  not  violated. 
Plagiarism  can  destroy  any  one’s  career  and  this  paper  creates 
awareness  of  plagiarism  softwares  among  research  scholars, 
faculty  members  and  helps  them  to  have  successful  academic 
careers in future by avoiding plagiarism.  

Keywords—  Plagiarism,  anti-plagiarism  software,  online 
plagiarism detection  tools,  plagiarism  checker,  copyright.,academic 
dishonesty, Plagiarism  Tracker. 

I.   INTRODUCTION  
Plagiarism  is  a  very  serious  and  common  problem  in 
Research.  Stealing  of  someone  else  work  is  not  only  common 
among research  scholars but also very common among  faculty 
members.  There  have  been many  plagiarism  cases  detected  in 
India  and  abroad.  For  example,  The  first  case:  A  research 
scholars  awarded  Ph.D.  in  the  year  1976  for  his  thesis  in 
English  entitled,  “A  Critical  Study  of  the  Suta  Samhita”.  As 
per  his  allegation,  almost  80%  of  his  thesis  has  been 
plagiarized  by  “another  scholar”  [1]  in  Hindi  verbatim 
including  footnotes,  charts  and  tables.  This  scholar  submitted 
his  thesis  entitled,  “Suta  Samhita  ka  Alocanatmak  Adhyayan” 
to  another  University  and  got  Ph.D.  in  the  year  1981.  In  the 
second case: A  “vice-chancellor”  [2] resigned  in 2003 after he 

and  a  student  were  found  guilty  of  plagiarism  of  a  paper 
(which formed part of the student's thesis). In the third case: A 
“professor”  [3]  is  accused  of  plagiarizing  more  than  70 
research  papers  published  between  2004  and  2007. University 
Executive  Council  has  banned  him 
from  undertaking 
examination  work  and  research  guidance.  He  has  been 
debarred  from  securing  further  promotions  and  appointments 
to  administrative  positions.  In  the  fourth  case:  A  “Chancellor 
and  the  Education Minister”  [4]  for  the  country,  has  resigned 
after  her  Ph.D.  was  revoked  following  an  investigation  into 
her  doctoral  thesis  that  found  evidence  of  plagiarism.  Above 
motioned  cases  not  only  describe  the  seriousness  of  the 
problem  but  also  show  that  plagiarism  can  destroy  any  one’s 
career. 
In  the  age  of  advanced  Information  and  Communication 
Technologies  (ICT)  plagiarism  has  become  more  actual  and 
turned  into  a  serious  problem.  Many  tools  have  been 
developed  for  detecting  similarities  in  files  [5].  These  tools 
automate  the  detection  process  and  allow  the  academic  to 
carry out the investigation process manually [6]. 
Plagiarism  detection  software  benefits  academicians, 
research  scholars and anyone  else  interested  in  safeguard  their 
writing.  By  using  plagiarism  detection  software  one  can 
ensure  that  the  text  is  unique.  Through  plagiarism  detection 
tools  research community can benefit by  having  their  research 
paper/theses  and  dissertation  checked  for  any  plagiarism  done 
unintentionally. 

II.  REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
Asim  , Ali, Hussam  and Vaclav  [7]  find  that  till  now  there 
is    no  software  that  can  100%  detect  or    prove  that  the 
document has been plagiarize, because each software and tools 
has  advantages  and  limitation. Arbib &  Eti Yaari  [8]  find  that 
students  perceive  plagiarism  offences  from  online  sources  as 
significantly  less dishonest  than  similar offences  using printed 
sources.  Smith,   Ghazali, & Minhad  [9]  suggested  that  factors 
contributing  to plagiarism include  lack  of  awareness,  lack  of 
understanding,  lack  of  competence,  and  personal attitudes. No 
evidence  was  found  to  support  the  suggestion  that  either 
pressure  or  the  availability  of  internet  facilities  had  increased 
the  incidence  of  plagiarism.  Kwong,  Ng, Mark  &  Wong  [10] 
find  that  faculty  members  and  students  do  not  share  a 
consensus 
on 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
seriousness

theft  or  misappropriation  of  intellectual  property  and  the 
of plagiarism and  collusion.  Students,  in  general,  commit 
substantial unattributed textual copying of another’s work.  
misconduct  due  to  academic  work,  pressure  for  grades,  and 
teachers'  unclear  instructions  of  academic  integrity.  Faculty 
members  rarely  report  cases  of  misconduct  to  the  university 
and  handle  the  cases  according  to  their  own  standard. 
Zimerman  [11]  find  that  there  is  a  definite  problem  involved 
in  the  interaction  of  international  student  in  the  higher 
education  setting  and  plagiarism.  Kaner  &  Fiedler  [12]  say 
that an appearance of  successful plagiarism prevention may  in 
fact  reflect  better  training  of  students  to  avoid  plagiarism 
detection  .Gorman  [13]  says  “Plagiarism has  been  common 
plagiarism for  fear  of  litigation.  “Litigation(cid:486)creep”  has  spread, 
among  generations  of  students  in  secondary  and  tertiary 
education  and  the  situation  has  not  improved.  Many  tertiary 
than  tackling  the  issue  head(cid:486)on”.  According  to  Alzahrani, 
institutions  almost  never  make  a  forceful  response  to  cases  of 
with universities regularly adopting avoidance measures rather 
Salim  and  Abraham  [14]  “Among  the  ways  of  plagiarism 
prevention is the use of plagiarism detectors; Turnitin is a very 
popular one. Academic institutions, publishers, and conference 
management  systems  have  started  to  use  detectors.  Examples 
include,  but  not  limited  to,  WCopyFind  that  is  used  by  the 
University  of  Virginia,  CrossCheck  that  is  invested  by 
Elsevier,  Springer,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology 
press,  and  other  renowned  publishers,  Docoloc  that  is 
integrated  with  EDAS  conference  management  system. 
Nowadays, many anti plagiarism tools have been built and can 
be found on the Internet”. 
III.  OBJECTIVE 
The objectives of this paper are as follows: 
•  To  identify  the  plagiarism  detection  tools  which 
are freely available online; and 
•  To suggest how to avoid plagiarism in research.  

IV.  SCOPE & LIMITATION 
There  are  many  commercial  plagiarism  software  available 
viz.    Copy  Catch  Gold,  EVE2:Essay  Verification  Engine,  J 
Plag,  Moss,  Turnitin,  EduTie.com,  PlagiServe,  Wordcheck 
etc.  but  this  paper    covers  anti-  plagiarism  tools  which  are 
freely available  online . 

V.   PLAGIARISM  
The  word  ‘plagiarism’  comes  from  the  Latin  word 
‘plagiare’  which  means  “to  kidnap’.  Plagiarism  is  a  type  of 
cheating  where  students  present  the  work  of  others  as  their 
own  for  the  purpose  of  academic  credit.  [15].  Plagiarism  is 
defined in many different ways, 
“Unacknowledged copying of documents or programs’’ [16] 
“The presentation of another person’s ideas or materials as if it 
were ones own” [17] 
“ The submission of the part or all of another person’s work as 
if  it  were  ones  own, without  the  knowledge  of  the  author  ,and 
with intention to deceive”[18] 
As  a  general  working  definition,  Office  of  Research 
Integrity  (ORI)  [19]  considers  plagiarism  to  include  both  the 

VI.  CIRCUMSTANCES OF PLAGIARISM 
Plagiarism  occur  under 
is 
two  circumstances  one 
intentional  another  is  unintentional.  “plagiarism,  a  form  of 
intellectual  dishonesty, 
involves  unintentionally  using 
someone  else's  work  without  properly  acknowledging  where 
the  idea(s)  came  from  (the  most  common  form  of  plagiarism) 
or  intentionally  copying  someone  else's  work  and  passing  it 
off as your own (the most serious form of plagiarism)”[20]. 

A.  Intentional plagiarism   
Intentional  plagiarism  occur 
intentionally 
if  person 
copying  other  material  and  not  citing  the  source  deliberately. 
It  includes,  copying  other’s  work,  copy  and  pasting  form 
online source, purchasing papers from paper mills etc. 

B.  Unintentional plagiarism 
Unintentional  plagiarism  occurs  when  even  if  a  person 
does  not  have  any    intention  to  plagiarized   but  he/she  has  not 
given  the  references  in  proper  manner    then  they  indulged  in 
plagiarism.  “Unintentional  plagiarism 
includes  careless 
paraphrasing,  paraphrasing  a  source  without  citing,  forget 
footnote etc.” [21]. 

VII. PLAGIARISM DETECTION TOOLS/SOFTWARE 
“Plagiarism  detection  is  the  process  of  featuring  the 
document,  analyzing  its  content,  unveiling  portions  that might 
be  plagiarized,  and  bringing  similar  source  documents,  if  they 
are  available.”  [22]  “Using  plagiarism  detection  tools  would 
benefit  the  scholarly  publication  process  by  helping  authors 
examine  their  own  work  and  by  allowing  reviewers  and 
editors to detect and deter plagiarism prior to publication.”[23] 
Plagiarism tools, while invaluable for discovering potential 
problems,  can  also  expose  cases  where  judgments  depend  on 
complex circumstances.[24].  
Plagiarism  detection  tools/Anti  –plagiarism  software  can 
be divided into two groups. 
A.  Proprietary/Commercial  anti-plagiarism 
software 
B.  Free online plagiarism tools/software 

A.  Proprietary or Commercial anti-plagiarism software/tools 
the  Latin 
“The 
from 
term proprietary is  derived 
word proprietas meaning property.  Proprietary 
software is 
software that is owned by an individual or a company (usually 
the  one 
that  developed 
it)”[25].  There 
is  a 
lot  of 
proprietary/commercial  anti-plagiarism  software  viz.  Turnitin, 
CopyCatch  Gold,  EVE2:Essay  Verification  Engine,  J  Plag, 
Moss  ,EduTie.com,  PlagiServe, Wordcheck  etc.  For  using  the 
commercial software user has to purchase the software. 

B.  Free online software/tools 
“Free software, which is generally the same as open source 
software,  is  available  at  no  cost  to  everyone,  and  it  can  be

unintentional variety. 
•  Researcher  should  give  citation  for  all  material 
whatever  he/she  is  using  for  his/her  research 
work. 
•  Researcher  should  know  how  anti  plagiarism 
tools work. 
If anyone takes away text from his/her own article 
for  writing  another  article  is  known  as  self 
plagiarism, 
therefore  researcher  should  give 
citation for that work also. 
•  People  some  times  change  the  word  in  the  text 
and  clam  it  as  their  own  yet,  then  also  falls  under 
plagiarism, 
therefore  researcher  should  give 
reference  for  that    idea  also which  he/she  is  using 
for  his/her  research  work  even  if    he/she  change 
the words. 
If the researcher use  someone else’s words as it is 
he/she  should always use quotation marks 
•  While  citing  the  sources  academic  style  sheet  ( 
like APA, MLA, Chicago) should be followed 
•  After  finishing  all  works  a  researcher    should 
check  through  online  plagiarism  software  before 
summiting his/her research work in anywhere 

IX.  BENEFITS OF USING ANTI-PLAGIARISM DETECTION TOOLS 
•  With  the  help  of  plagiarism  detection  tools 
researcher can  find out  if any  other person copied 
his/her research writing. 
It  helps  to  improve  writing  skills  as  some 
plagiarism tools check grammar also. 
• 
It  filters the duplicate content. 
•  These  tools  are  useful  to  avoid  intellectual 
property issues. 
• 
It promotes effective and efficient research. 
•  These  softwares  are  useful  for  research  scholars, 
website creator, and publisher. 
•  Plagiarism 
to  access  multiple 
tools  allow 
databases. 
It allows to detect any incidents of plagiarism and 
helps to take appropriate action. 
It helps the researcher  to properly cite references 
It creates awareness of plagiarism among research 
scholars,  faculty  members  and  help  them  to  have 
successful  academic  careers  in  future  by  avoiding 
plagiarism. 

X.  LIMITATIONS OF DETECTION TOOLS 
“The drawbacks of detection tools are: 
• 
Inability  to  distinguish  correctly  cited  text  from 
plagiarized text.  
•  Books  are 
typically  not  searched  by 
services. 
•  Detect  plagiarized  words,  not  plagiarized 
thoughts or ideas.  
Inability  to  process  textual  images  for  similarity 
checks”[46]. 

XI.   SUGGESTIONS TO AVOID UNINTENTIONAL PLAGIARISM  
If a researcher is intentionally plagiarizing in his/her paper, 
thesis, or dissertation, he/she    should  stop  it. Otherwise  it may 
spoil  his/her  carrier.  But  sometimes  even  if  a  researcher  has 
not  intestinally  plagiarized  but  has  not  given  references  in 

XII. CONCLUSION 
In  this  technological  era,  plagiarism  detection  is  essential 
for  protecting  the  written  work.  It  is  concluded  that  all 
research  scholars  and  authors  of  journal  articles  should  be 
aware  of  plagiarism  and  anti-plagiarism  softwares.  Now  -a  -
days  “University  Grants  Commission”  (UGC)  insists  research 
scholars  to  send  one  soft  copy  to  the  thesis  to  “Information 
and  Library  Network”  (INFLIBNET)  while  submitting  to 
Universities.  So  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  have 
to use one   of these anti plagiarism softwares in checking their 
thesis or  research paper before  submitting  to  universities. This 
will  definitely  improve  the  quality  of  the  thesis  work  of  the 
research scholars and authors of journal article.
